    review:
      "Great location, really pleasant and clean rooms, but the thing that makes this such a good place to stay are the staff. All of the people are incredibly helpful and generous with their time and advice. We travelled with two six year olds and lots of luggage and despite the stairs up to the elevator this was one of the nicest places we stayed in the four weeks we were in Europe.",

    review:
      "Don't doubt, this hotel is perfect. Not only for his quaified staff but for a lot of advantages. The location is very close to the Station and the main attractions in Firenze. The restaurant is very good and breakfast is superior (anything for all tastes). Classic, clean and comfortable. If I come back to Firenze one day I'll stay in Albani without doubt.",

    review:
      "Lapo was in contact with us before we arrived, to check times and arrange check in. Our flight was delayed but he had it all organised and we were soon settled in our clean, comfortable room. The room was comfortable and had ample storage space. Wet room and hot shower were great. Tea and Coffee facilities were in our room too. The place is a 20 min walk to the duomo and 10 mins from reasonable priced restaurants, 5 mins from the main station. It was an ideal base for us. Check out was drama free and we were able to store our cases there till we had to leave. Thank you Lapo got a lovely stay",
